## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Javascript/Node.js
- SQL/MySQL
- NPM
​
### What I learned
​
Honestly it was nice to try to combine the knowledge from previous challenges to create this one. Felt like they have really built upon one another and this one added SQL to the mix. 
​
### Continued development
​
I think having the connection process on index and everything else on another file was sort of backwards of what I should have. Tried connecting certain functions between the two to make it work did not seem right but I am very stubborn and wanted to figure it out the way I did it. It's kinda happened a lot where I seem certain its going along smoothly but falls apart at the last second. Seeking a tutor for this is my next step before resubmitting because it still is not obvious why my lines with queies/promises().queries were getting the error not a function because I had linked my SQL connection over...

### Useful resources
​
- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_keywords.asp) - Helpful resource when working with SQL
- [Example resource 2](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fixed-point-types.html#:~:text=Standard%20SQL%20requires%20that%20DECIMAL,DECIMAL(%20M%20%2C0)%20.) - decimals werent covered in the link above.
- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/table) - helps learn how to use console.table
- [Example resource 2](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-cheat-sheet.aspx) - kept this around in my browser as a reminder
- [Example resource 1](https://morioh.com/p/0b9636237f5c) - similar to the npm inquirer page but better displayed and examples.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-switch-statement-in-javascript) - Really was confused on how to proceed after creating the beginning to the mainMenu prompt but this helped. Seemed better than a bunc of If Else statements.
- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mysql.asp) - since this project is local based and are not using routes, this helped with connecting.
